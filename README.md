# [C++] SimpleGame  - Basic
<br>

### Basic Ideas:
---
* We have one default hero and he meets different enemies.
* An "area" means a set of enemy's.
* At the beginning of each round - fight, the hero decides with how many enemies he wants to fight.
* The hero can choose if he want to fight, or not, with each enemy.
* A fight means alternate blows between the hero and the enemy and the other way around
* At the end of each area, the hero HP will regenerate.
