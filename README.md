# [C++] SimpleGame  - Basic
<br>

### Basic Ideas:
---
* We have one default hero and he meets different enemies.
* At the beginning of each fight (areas), the hero decides how many
enemies want to fight.
* The hero can choose if he want to fight with each enemy or not
* A fight means alternate blows between the hero and the enemy and the other way around
* At the end of each fight(area), the hero HP will regenerate.

|ATK|20  |  2 - 30 |
